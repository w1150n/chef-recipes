  "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides a resource for restarting a chef-run mid-way. When a `restart` resource is encountered, it will check whether it has restarted there previously. The restart can be at various levels depending which \"restart context\" was specified. The \"chef\" restart context will re-execute chef by forking a new process. The \"login_shell\" method will re-run chef from whole new login shell, also re-executing the all .profile, bashrc, etc. Finally The \"node\" restart context will perform a reboot of the entire operating system. The chef run will continue from that point, automatically at next boot.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* The CHEF-828 patch on mixlib-cli.

Can be \"chef\", \"login_shell\" or \"node\" (context=name, default)\n    shell          - Bypass shell detection for \"node\" and \"login_shell\" methods. eg \"tcsh\", \"zsh\" \n    creates        - creates \"file\". Do not restart if \"file\" exists\n    before_restart - A shell cmd (as string) or recipe code (ruby block). For a \"node\" restart,\n                     all the reboot scripts are written before this block is executed.\n                     Use as a guard around commands which may trigger a system reboot.\n\n\n= Resctrictions - Important!!:\n\n* General (watch out!!)\n   - We have tested in chef-solo only!!

Or encrypted filesystems such as FileVault. There is not really any guarantee that such volumes will be mounted and available to chef during the next boot cycle. Use the recipe attribute to ignore / disable.\n\n* Node restarts - if the chef run fails for any reason\n   - the whole run is deemed invalid, and the boot scripts folder deleted\n   - execution must begin again from the beginning of the recipe, not from the last restart point\n   - not_if, only_if and \"creates\" will still be respected, so any already completed actions will skipped over and not be repeated\n   - we think this is safer, in case you had gone in, edited your recipes and moved about the restart points\n\n= USAGE:\n\nTypically, we need to restart when chef (or one of our chef recipes) reles and depends upon some essential software update which was initialed earlier on in our recipes.
